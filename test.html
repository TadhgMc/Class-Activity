            My name is Tadhg, I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. In high school I was in band and JROTC. 
            After school I worked in a couple of fairly different feilds. First I worked at a Taco Bell. 
            After that I worked in 2 different dealerships, where I worked as a vehicle technician, service advisor, 
            parts specialist, and a car salesman. Following that i felt i needed a big career change and tried 
            working in a warehouse for a while, but that did not fit well! I took a break, then began serving at a restraunt.
            Wanting to get into more of a career, I tried doing electronics repair, but was unable to find a rewarding career 
            there as well. Which brings me to where I am now, learning to be a full stack web developer!<br>
